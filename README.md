Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts student exam performance based on various factors such as study time, internet access, parental support, school environment, and more.
It uses a Logistic Regression model to classify whether a student is likely to pass or fail.

What I have learned:
-The difference between regression and classification
-How to use the Logistic Regression model in Python
How to evaluate models using:
-Accuracy
-Confusion Matrix
-Precision, Recall, F1-score
-ROC Curve & AUC Score
-How to visualize results with Seaborn and Matplotlib

The dataset:

The  have used a dataset that i found on kaggle which is called 'Student Performance Factors', which includes attributes like:
-Study time
-Attendance
-Internet access
-Parental involvement
-Extra-curricular activities
-Exam scores

Languages and libraries used: 
-Language: Python 
-Libraries Used:
pandas → data analysis
numpy → numerical operations
matplotlib, seaborn → visualization
scikit-learn → ML model & evaluation

Steps: 
-Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas
-Cleaned missing values and encoded categorical data
-Split data into training and testing sets
-Trained a Logistic Regression model
-Evaluated model performance using multiple metrics
-Visualized results using confusion matrix and ROC curve

The model performed very well, correctly classifying most students’ outcomes.
